Hello, I'm Mel. 

I help people and organizations do meaningful, impactful work in publics (media, libraries and archives, civic tech, .gov) infused with a sense of civic joy.

You can [see some of my work here.](https://melodykramer.github.io/projects/)

My work and research has been featured by The New York Times, iTunes, Niemanâ€™s Journalism Lab, Mashable, Poynter, the Shorty Awards, Knight-Mozilla Open News, USA Today, GigaOm, and the Village Voice Web Awards, among others. 

I live in Carrboro, NC with my very-offline family.
