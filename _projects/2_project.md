<p><h3>Wikimedia Foundation</h3><p>
    <p><h4><b>Role:</b>Led audience research for communications team</h4><p>

The Wikimedia Foundation wanted to develop an integrated, holistic view of their ecosystem of audiences, which include end users, intermediaries, and movement audiences in order to better serve all of these users. They also wanted to organize their understanding of audiences based on user experience (rather than based on organizational structure.)<p>

Through a series of <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation/Communications/Audience_research/Process">audience definition workshops</a>, I helped the foundation better understand their approach to audience development, and challenges to understanding and serving those audiences so we could define processes for audience development within various product teams. This helped the Foundation develop communicaiton, product, and partnership strategies.

<p><h3>NPR</h3><p>
    <p><h4><b>Role:</b>Product lead, internal analytics dashboard</h4><p>

I led a six-week development cycle to <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2014/04/building-an-analytics-culture-in-a-newsroom-how-npr-is-trying-to-expand-its-digital-thinking/">reimagine internal analytics dashboards</a> to better suit NPR's reporters and editors. The dashboard was a key element in shifting the newsroom towards a more data-driven culture.

<p><h3>American Press Institute</h3><p>
    <p><h4><b>Role:</b>Lead content design and project management</h4><p>

With Betsy O'Donovan, I produced <a href="https://americanpressinstitute.org/how-to-build-a-metrics-savvy-newsroom/">a detailed report</a> on how to build a metrics-savvy newsroom.

In the course of our reporting, we interviewed two dozen journalists and data analysts across 20 organizations, hunting for practices that were broad enough to be useful to most newsrooms, but specific enough to provide at least a basic blueprint.
