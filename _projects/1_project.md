I oversee the communications, branding, digital media, and media relations strategy for a 300-person research center at the University of North Carolin - Chapel Hill that has generated over $250 million in grants over the past 5 years. I collaborate with a team of professionals who create content across digital, social, and print platforms, highlighting the achievements of our faculty, staff, and students. 

I also provide communications and digital strategy support to our faculty and senior leadership team, helping to promote the impact of our research to external and internal audiences. That can vary from prepping a faculty member for congressional testimony, to creating a social media strategy for a longitudinal study, to leading UX and content strategy for a website redesign.
