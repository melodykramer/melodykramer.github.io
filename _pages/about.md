Hello, I'm Mel. 

I'm a librarian and journalist working at the intersection of product, technology, and audience-facing teams. I help people and organizations do meaningful, impactful work in publics (media, libraries and archives, civic tech, .gov) infused with a sense of joy.

Recently, I've:

- Served as librarian-in-residence for the Knight Election Hub, a pop-up newsroom connecting journalists with election expertise during the 2024 election cycle
- Led a [pop-up newsroom](https://wnclocalnews.com) to support journalists in WNC with products and editorial tools in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene
- Archived every local political candidate website in the country over two cycles, ensuring that academics and journalists can access them in the Internet Archive
- Shaped communications for a group of population researchers and demographers at UNC-Chapel Hill
- Advised a foundation on how to create community and connections within its fellowship program
- [Mapped audiences](https://melodykramer.github.io/projects/2_project/) for the 5th largest website in the world

You can [see some of my work here.](https://melodykramer.github.io/projects/)

My work and research has been featured by The New York Times, iTunes, Niemanâ€™s Journalism Lab, Mashable, Poynter, the Shorty Awards, Knight-Mozilla Open News, USA Today, GigaOm, and the Village Voice Web Awards, among others. 

I live in Carrboro, NC with my very-offline family. In my spare time, I serve as chair of the water and sewage board and contribute to a [civic news collective](https://www.triangleblogblog.com) covering Chapel Hill and Carrboro.
