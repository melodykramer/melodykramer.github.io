Over my 20-year career, I've worked with some of the largest nonprofits and brands in the world, and led teams and projects alongside academics, engineers, journalists, [non-profit executives](https://wikimediafoundation.org/), and [federal government departments](https://18f.gsa.gov/). 

I cut my teeth writing intros for Terry Gross and jokes for Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me, and have spent most of my career identifying and building audiences, translating and curating information, and increasing engagement in person, in print, and online for mission-driven organizations and causes.

You can see projects I've worked on here.

I'm a trained librarian with a knack for both qualitative and quantitative feedback: I co-led the team that created NPR's internal analytics dashboard and worked on a project alongside the Internet Archive to capture every local political candidate website in the country, over two election cycles. My work and research has been featured by The New York Times, iTunes, Niemanâ€™s Journalism Lab, Mashable, Poynter, the Shorty Awards, Knight-Mozilla Open News, USA Today, GigaOm, and the Village Voice Web Awards, among others. 

Outside of work, I help run a [civic news cooperative](https://triangleblogblog.com/) focused on Chapel Hill and Carrboro, NC. We've broken major stories which have subsequently been featured on HBO and local and national news organizations. We blend humor with facts, and cover everything from the state legislature to local advisory board meetings using print, digital, and social.
