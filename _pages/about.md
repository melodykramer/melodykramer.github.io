Hello, I'm Mel. 

<b> I'm actively looking for my next career move. After working at NPR, 18F, and the Wikimedia Foundation, I transitioned to leading comms/digital for a large group of social scientists and demographers at UNC-Chapel Hill. I’ll be leaving that position in October, which is both scary and exciting. </b>

Over the past few years, I also picked up a library degree and launched a [civic news outlet](https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/06/triangle-blog-blog-aims-for-a-sweet-spot-between-local-news-and-progressive-politics/) that combines humor and investigative journalism, and reaches tens of thousands of people across North Carolina. We fill information gaps and have broken major stories which have subsequently been picked up by HBO and local and national news orgs. We [cover everything from the state legislature to local advisory board meetings](https://triangleblogblog.com/) using print, digital, social, and in-person events.

I’d love to find a full-time role where I can lead strategy and audience efforts to contribute to impactful, public-facing, mission-driven work in the non-profit/democracy-building/civic/media spaces.I’ve worked on everything from redesigning onboarding processes at 18F to designing websites and other digital tools that made NPR better able to reach audiences. I love working across teams and systems and tackling hard problems to help organizations better fulfill their mission.

My work and research has been featured by The New York Times, iTunes, Nieman’s Journalism Lab, Mashable, Poynter, the Shorty Awards, Knight-Mozilla Open News, USA Today, GigaOm, and the Village Voice Web Awards, among others. 

I live in Carrboro, NC with my very-offline family.
