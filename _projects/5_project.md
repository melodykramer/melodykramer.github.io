<p><h3>Triangle Blog Blog</h3><p>
    <p><h5><b>Role:</b> Co-creator, Editor</h5><p>

I co-created and now help lead a civics blog that fills information gaps in Chapel Hill and Carrboro, NC. The model is unique: We're an all volunteer organization and over 60 people have contributed pieces. We reach tens of thousands of people and fill information gaps in our local news ecosystem.<p>

In the past two years, we've published <a href="https://triangleblogblog.com/archives/">over 800 stories</a> covering everything from UNC to the school board to town council and pickleball. We do deep dives and create in whatever way makes the most sense - a chart, stickers, a parade, a timeline, a deep dive. <p>

It's the best, most experimental, most civically-engaged group I've ever worked with, and just a joy to work on. <p>

Our newsletter has a 70%+ open rate and our election coverage <a href="https://indyweek.com/news/orange/five-takeaways-from-chapel-hills-municipal-election/">helped</a> "drive record turnout."<p> You can read an interview with our initial board <a href="https://editdesk.wordpress.com/2023/01/04/qa-with-triangle-blog-blog/">here</a>.

<p><h3>18F</h3><p>
    <p><h5><b>Role:</b> Writer, editor</h5><p>

At 18F, part of our content strategy was to highlight users of our products in their own words. This not only helped with product adoption, but created a community of users to bounce off each other for support. Some examples:<p>

We developed an <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov">analytics dashboard for .gov domains</a> - within months, it had been adapted by local and state-level governments to publicly monitor their own web traffic. Here's <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/01/06/tips-for-adapting-analytics-usa-gov/">an interview with users in two cities and one state.</a>

This was then developed into <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/04/13/7-18f-projects-that-state-and-local-governments-can-reuse/">a blog post</a> highlighting other reusable projects; when those were reused, we then <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/04/05/three-teams-using-the-draft-us-web-design-standards-talk-about-their-experiences/">highlighted those users</a>. Nice feedback loops as users further engaged with civic tech infastructure. <p>


<p><h3>Public media membership models</h3><p>
    <p><h5><b>Role:</b> Writer, researcher</h5><p>

I spent several months at Harvard University on a Visiting Nieman Fellowship, where I researched expanding the definition of public media membership beyond the traditional monetary model. By elevating non-financial forms of contributions that provide valuable support for local stations (e.g., digitizing an archive, coding a new app, volunteering at an event), my belief was that we could inculcate a sense of ownership and identity among listeners — allowing them to feel more connected to and invested in public media’s content, work, and mission.<p>

I interviewed over 60 people for case studies, and wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190225074236/http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/07/putting-the-public-into-public-media-membership/">an extensive guide</a> to what I learned. This was later used in the Membership Puzzle, and by stations around the country.<p>

Here's <a href="https://medium.com/the-engaged-journalism-lab/rethinking-membership-models-for-journalism-with-melody-kramer-41f578b21736">a great writeup</a> by Josh Stearns of the work.
