Hello, I'm Mel. 

<b> I'm on the job market! After five years leading communications for the Carolina Population Center and Carolina Demography, I'm finishing up a grant application and some projects and will be looking for my next full-time job. 

I'm looking for a content or audience role in which I can use my unique skillset to contribute to impactful, public-facing, mission-driven work. </b>

Throughout my career, I've worked with some of the largest nonprofits and brands in the world, leading teams and projects alongside academics, engineers, journalists, [non-profit executives](https://wikimediafoundation.org/), and [federal government employees](https://18f.gsa.gov/). 

I cut my teeth writing intros for Terry Gross and jokes for Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me, and now spend my time identifying and building audiences, translating and curating information, and increasing engagement in person, in print, and online.

You can [see some of my work here.](https://melodykramer.github.io/projects/)

I'm a trained librarian with a knack for both qualitative and quantitative feedback: I co-led the team that created [NPR's internal analytics dashboard](https://www.niemanlab.org/2014/04/building-an-analytics-culture-in-a-newsroom-how-npr-is-trying-to-expand-its-digital-thinking/) and worked alongside the Internet Archive to capture every local political candidate website in the country. My work and research has been featured by The New York Times, iTunes, Niemanâ€™s Journalism Lab, Mashable, Poynter, the Shorty Awards, Knight-Mozilla Open News, USA Today, GigaOm, and the Village Voice Web Awards, among others. 

Outside of work, I help run a [civic news collective](https://triangleblogblog.com/) focused on Chapel Hill and Carrboro, NC. We fill information gaps and have broken major stories which have subsequently been picked up by HBO and local and national news orgs. We blend humor with facts, and cover everything from the state legislature to local advisory board meetings using print, digital, social, and in-person events.

I live in Carrboro, NC with my very-offline family.
