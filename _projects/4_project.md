<p><h3>News for Betty</h3><p>
    <p><h5><b>Role:</b> Co-creator</h5><p>

A few years ago, I went over my friend Betty’s apartment to drop off some spaghetti and meatballs. Betty was 89 and a news junkie. After we sat down and drank some tea, she asked me to help her find some news stories she wanted to read on her iPad.<p>

“Sure,” I said, as we peered at her screen. “Why don’t you show me what you’re doing and I’ll see if I can help.”<p>

Betty began to tap around on news websites. I watched her grow increasingly frustrated when she accidentally clicked on an ad or parts of the story she didn’t mean to click on. I also saw her grow increasingly worried that she wasn’t going to be able to return to her story or accidentally click on malware.<p>

When I went home that night, I wrote a blog post about Betty and described what might be an ideal website for someone with limited eyesight or who might be unfamiliar with technology. It would have “no pop-ups, no overlaid ads, and big and easy scroll buttons,” I wrote. “It would need maybe two steps necessary to leave the page.”<p>

A reader named Daniel reached out and said he wanted to help me make a website for Betty. In a few days, we put together News for Betty, a pretty minimal website that delivered Betty’s news. This <a href="https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2015/designing-journalism-products-for-accessibility/">Poynter column</a> sums up what I learned from the experience.<p>

<p><h3>Rethinking a news homepage</h3><p>
    <p><h5><b>Role:</b> Idea generator</h5><p>


A few years ago, I gathered together a lot of very smart people who don’t work in news and asked them to design a new news homepage.<p>

By news homepage, I mean any way for a user to first encounter content. A push notification could very well be the new news homepage. (Related: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190302124455/http://www.melodyjk.com/what-does-a-better-push-notification-feel-like/">Ways to think about push notifications</a>.) An app is a news homepage. An article or a newsletter is a news homepage. If you listen to the news, Overcast or Soundcloud or the iTunes store may be your homepage. YouTube can be your homepage. Homepage, to me, is simply a shorthand version for any of these things.<p>

The idea was to think about accessibility, temporal relationships to news, geography - all of the many and mundane ways we encounter information throughout our lives.<p>

<p><h3>NPR quotable tool</h3><p>
    <p><h5><b>Role:</b> Idea generator</h5><p>

Audio is not a visual medium. We wanted an accessible way to share our stories on social media that would immediately resonate with audiences. In 2014, I helped create the Quotable tool, which allowed any NPR reporter to turn a quote from their story into a well designed image bearing that quote and the NPR logo.<p> The American Press Institute <a href="https://americanpressinstitute.org/engaged-newsroom/">wrote up the tool here.</a> It was later adapted by public radio stations across the country, as well as Vox, The New York Times, and Buzzfeed.
