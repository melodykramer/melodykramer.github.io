<p><h3>Wikimedia Foundation website</h3><p>
    <p><h4><b>Role:</b>Lead content design and project management</b>

For many years, the Wikimedia Foundation flagship website was, itself, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170202082715/https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home">a wiki</a>: the same editable interface that's present on every Wikipedia page. This was great if you were a Wikipedia power user, but difficult to navigate for other users.

In 2018, the Foundation decided to redesign their website based on the work we did during our <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation/Communications/Audience_research">audience research project.</a> I managed and led content and editorial strategy for the website redesign, managing more than 40 internal and external stakeholders through a complex editorial process.
