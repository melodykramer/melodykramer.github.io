<p><h3>News for Betty</h3><p>
    <p><h5><b>Role:</b> Co-creator</h5><p>

A few years ago, I went over my friend Betty’s apartment to drop off some spaghetti and meatballs. Betty was 89 and a news junkie. After we sat down and drank some tea, she asked me to help her find some news stories she wanted to read on her iPad.

“Sure,” I said, as we peered at her screen. “Why don’t you show me what you’re doing and I’ll see if I can help.”

Betty began to tap around on news websites. I watched her grow increasingly frustrated when she accidentally clicked on an ad or parts of the story she didn’t mean to click on. I also saw her grow increasingly worried that she wasn’t going to be able to return to her story or accidentally click on malware.

When I went home that night, I wrote a blog post about Betty and described what might be an ideal website for someone with limited eyesight or who might be unfamiliar with technology. It would have “no pop-ups, no overlaid ads, and big and easy scroll buttons,” I wrote. “It would need maybe two steps necessary to leave the page.”

A reader named Daniel reached out and said he wanted to help me make a website for Betty. In a few days, we put together News for Betty, a pretty minimal website that delivered Betty’s news. This <a href="https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2015/designing-journalism-products-for-accessibility/">Poynter column</a> sums up what I learned from the experience.
