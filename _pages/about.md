Hello, I'm Mel. 

I help people and organizations do meaningful, impactful work in publics (media, libraries and archives, civic tech, .gov) infused with a sense of civic joy.

Recently, I've:

- Led a [pop-up newsroom](https://wnclocalnews.com) to support journalists in WNC with products and tools in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene
- Shaped communications for a group of population researchers at UNC-Chapel Hill
- Helped a beloved public radio show think about who their audiences could be and how to reach them
- Advised a foundation on how to create community and connections within its fellowship program
- Mapped audiences for the 5th largest website in the world

You can [see some of my work here.](https://melodykramer.github.io/projects/)

My work and research has been featured by The New York Times, iTunes, Niemanâ€™s Journalism Lab, Mashable, Poynter, the Shorty Awards, Knight-Mozilla Open News, USA Today, GigaOm, and the Village Voice Web Awards, among others. 

I live in Carrboro, NC with my very-offline family. In my spare time, I serve as chair of the water and sewage board and run a [civic news collective](https://www.triangleblogblog.com) that infuses my community with civic joy (and also provides investigative news.)
