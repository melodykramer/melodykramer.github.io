I led a team of accomplished communications professionals to grow Wikipedia's audience and to deepen relationships that existing audiences had with Wikipedia, the 5th largest website in the world. As part of this work, I managed the Wikimedia Foundation blog and led the social media team. I also worked closely with our product and global teams to help digital traffic grow, increase our reach on search and social, increase donations during fundraising campaigns, and develop tools to reach new audiences to support Wikimedia.

Accomplishments:

- Designed and led campaign to encourage people to freely license their solar eclipse photos to Wikimedia. Over 2,300 people learned to use Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, uploading photos of the August 2017 solar eclipse.
- Led <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation/Communications/Audience_research">interdepartmental audience research project</a> to better understand the Wikimedia Foundation's current perception of our audiences, and its current approach to audience development, to identify gaps in the Wikimedia Foundationâ€™s understanding of audiences and provide common framework for audience development and segmentation.
- Designed modules for journalists and researchers to better understand Wikipedia as source and research opportunity.
- Served as digital lead for brand strategy work related to Wikipedia.
- Wrote and edited blog stories picked up by Washington Post, The Guardian, El Pais, and dozens of other media outlets.
- Managed and led content and editorial strategy for new Wikimedia Foundation website, managing more than 40 internal and external stakeholders and finishing 50% under estimated budget.

The Wikimedia Foundation wanted to develop an integrated, holistic view of their ecosystem of audiences, which include end users, intermediaries, and movement audiences in order to better serve all of these users. They also wanted to organize their understanding of audiences based on user experience (rather than based on organizational structure.)

Through a series of <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation/Communications/Audience_research/Process">audience definition workshops</a>, I helped the foundation better understand their approach to audience development, and challenges to understanding and serving those audiences so we could define processes for audience development within various product teams. This helped the Foundation develop communicaiton, product, and partnership strategies.
